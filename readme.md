## Go Lang Sample HTTP Server
I spent the day learning a bit about Golang, and decided I would take advantage of its built in net/http package. This was something I threw together quickly after reviewing the documentation and taking some time to dig into Go's history.

To take this for a spin:

 - Install Go on your local machine
 - Clone this repository
 - Navigate to the project root and type in the CLI, `go run .`
 - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`
 - Play with the URL paths and examine the output!
